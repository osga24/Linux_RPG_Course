Today was an ordinary day#, but somehow everything felt slightly off#.  
I woke up early#, made some coffee#, and looked outside the window#.  
The sky was blue#, the birds were loud#, and my inbox was already full#.  
Maybe it’s just one of those days# when nothing special happens#,  
but you can’t shake the feeling that something’s coming#.  
I tried writing a bit#, deleted everything#, and went for a walk# instead.  
By the time I got back#, the coffee was cold#, but at least my mind was clear#.
